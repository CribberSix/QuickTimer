Introduction
============

``QuickTimer`` is an easy to use python package to handle time measurements in code. 

The aim here was to define a single object which would allow users to easily track passed time throughout their code, as well as to present the tracking results in a fancy way.  


Motivation
**********

As someone who runs a lot of data transformation code and needs to keep an eye on performance during specific steps, I was annoyed by how much time I had to invest again and again to track my code's progress and performance in an orderly fashion. 

Existing packages don't offer the ease-of-use I expected from such products or formatted the output horribly, hence this package was born.
