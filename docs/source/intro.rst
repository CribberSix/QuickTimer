Introduction
============

``QuickTimer`` is a high-level OO Python package which aims to provide an easy and intuitive way of tracking your code runtime. 

The aim here was to define a single object which would allow users to perform the various operations performed 


Motivation
**********

As a newbie experimenter/hobbyist in the field of IoT using BLE communications, I found it pretty hard to identify a Python package which would enable one to use a Raspberry Pi (Zero W inthis case) to swiftly scan, connect to and read/write from/to a nearby BLE device (GATT server).

This package is intended to provide a quick, as well as (hopefully) easy to undestand, way of getting a simple BLE GATT client up and running, for all those out there, who, like myself, are hands-on learners and are eager to get their hands dirty from early on.
